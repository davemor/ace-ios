        <h1>About ARC</h1>
        <p>ARC Edinburgh was a winning entry in the 2014 Edinburgh apps competition. Since then we have been working hard with the recovery community to create a useful app to support them and others during recovery.  This is our chance to say a big thank you to everyone involved for all of your time and contributions. Thanks for the cake too!</p>
        <p>This app has been developed in close contact with City of Edinburgh Council and Edinburgh Alcohol and Drug Partnership. We make every effort to ensure that dates and times of support meeting or groups are up to date. This a prototype of ARC so please tell us if any of the information is wrong, or if you have any other feedback or suggestions.</p>        <p><a href="http://arcapp.co.uk/">Learn more on our website.</a></p>

        <h1>About the Community Calendar</h1>
        <p>You might notice that your calendar already has details of community events you may be interested in. We take this information from the Recovery Community Calendar. You can find the full <a href="https://recoverycommunitycalendar.hasacalendar.co.uk">Community Calendar online</a>. Anyone can add events, so if you or someone you know wants to let the recovery community know, you can pop it in the Community Calendar. Once you do this, details of your event will show in the calendar of anyone with the ARC app! Cool huh?</p>
        <p>Our community calendar has been created by JMB Technology Ltd and running costs are paid by the City of Edinburgh Council.</p>
