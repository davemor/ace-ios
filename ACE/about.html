        <h1>About the Community Calendar</h1>
        <p>You might notice that your calendar already has details of community events you may be interested in. We take this information from the Recovery Community Calendar. You can find the full Community Calendar <a href="https://recoverycommunitycalendar.hasacalendar.co.uk">online</a>. Anyone can add events, so if you or someone you know wants to let the recovery community know, you can pop it in the Community Calendar. Once you do this, details of your event will show in the calendar of anyone with the ARC app! Cool huh?</p>
        
            <p>Our community calendar has been created by JMB Technology Ltd and running costs are paid by the City of Edinburgh Council</p>
