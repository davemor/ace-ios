SMART F\u0026F will help participants to view their own behaviours, challenge their thinking and find more effective ways to interact with their loved one, as well as learning ways to empower themselves.\r\n","contact_name":"","telephone":"","created_at":"2015-12-09T15:00:44.836Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T14:22:33.528Z","website":"http://www.smartrecovery.org.uk/"},{"id":11,"name":"Co-Dependents Anonymous","description":"\r\nCo-Dependents Anonymous (CoDA) is a set of informal self-help groups made up of men and women with a common interest in working through the problems that co-dependency has caused in their lives. CoDA is based on AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) and uses an adapted version of their Twelve Steps and Traditions as a central part of its suggested programme of recovery.\r\n \r\nTo attend CoDA meetings, all you need is the willingness to work at having healthy relationships. This means that all kinds of people attend meetings. Individual members can and do have differing political, religious and other affiliations, but since these are not relevant to the business of recovery from co-dependency, no comment is made about them.\r\n \r\nAll meetings begin with an introduction which usually includes the Twelve Steps and Traditions, a welcome to newcomers, and an explanation of the format the meeting will take. There may be a speaker, or a reading of a Step or a topic. The meeting is then open for people to share their experiences, feelings and recovery with the group. There is no obligation to share if you do not wish to, whether you are a newcomer or a long-established member. Each meeting usually incorporates a collection to cover the expenses of the group (eg hire of the meeting room) but CoDA is non-profit making. The meeting will end with a special prayer, called the Serenity Prayer. After the meeting, newcomers who would like more information can use this time to have their questions answered by more established members.\r\n\r\nAm I Co-Dependent?\r\n \r\nYou may be wondering: 'Am I Co-Dependent?' 'What is Co-Dependence?' Many of us want precise definitions and diagnostic criteria before we will decide. At CoDA, we respectfully allow psychiatric and psychological professionals to provide these, but what we do offer from our own experience are characteristic attitudes and behaviour patterns that describe what our co-dependent histories have been like.\r\n \r\nWe believe that recovery begins with an honest self-diagnosis. We came to accept our inability to maintain healthy and nurturing relationships with ourselves and others. We began to recognise that the cause lay in long-standing destructive patterns of living. We have found these patterns to fall into four major categories: denial, low self-esteem, compliance and control. The checklist of patterns and characteristics is offered as a tool to aid in self-evaluation. It may be particularly helpful to newcomers as they begin to understand co-dependence. It may also aid those who have been in recovery for a while to determine what traits still need attention and transformation.\r\n \r\nAfter completing this checklist we suggest that you continue attending CoDA meetings for several weeks. Listen to the similarities and not the differences. Search out members of the fellowship you believe you can trust and discuss your checklist answers with them. If you come to accept that you are, indeed, co-dependent, then you will be ready to begin the Twelve Steps of recovery, and to seek a sponsor to guide you through the process.\r\n","contact_name":"Mike ","telephone":"07895 914059","created_at":"2016-02-17T11:17:27.354Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T14:23:15.839Z","website":"http://www.coda-uk.org/index.php"},{"id":12,"name":" Adult Children of Alcoholics and Dysfunctional Families UK ","description":"Adult Children of Alcoholics is an anonymous program of women and men who grew up in alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional homes. \r\n\r\nWe discover how childhood affected us in the past and influences us in the present.
